Hello there, this is Andrea! I am a postdoc at University of Pisa focusing on teaching ML models to learn what they do not know.

My PhD thesis focused on Selective Prediction, a framework that extends supervised learning by allowing ML models to abstain from making predictions on examples that are too hard to classify. This is a crucial feature for real-world applications, where the cost of making a mistake can be high.

My research interests (beyond Selective Prediction) include: learning to defer (LtD), causal inference and fair AI.
