Hello there, this is Andrea! I am a postdoc at University of Pisa focusing on teaching ML models to learn what they do not know.

I obtained a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University (Milan, Italy) in 2018 and
a PhD in Data Science from Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa, Italy) in 2024.

During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of professor [Salvatore Ruggieri](https://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/) 
and [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/francesca-chiaromonte).

My thesis focused on Selective Prediction, a framework that extends supervised learning by allowing ML models
to abstain from making predictions on examples that are too hard to classify. 
This is a crucial feature for real-world applications, where the cost of making a mistake can be high.

My research interests currently include abstaining systems, deferring systems, causal inference and fair AI.
